Send real-time PCM audio (16-bit integer) to your device speakers, from your Flutter app!

## No Dependencies

FlutterPcmSound has zero dependencies besides Flutter, Android, iOS, and MacOS themselves.

## Web

Web support is available on [this fork](https://github.com/keyur2maru/flutter_pcm_sound/tree/master) by [@keyur2maru](https://github.com/keyur2maru)

## *Not* for Audio Files

Unlike other plugins, `flutter_pcm_sound` does *not* use audio files (For example: [sound_pool](https://pub.dev/packages/soundpool)).

Instead, `flutter_pcm_sound` is for apps that generate audio in realtime a few milliseconds before you hear it. For example, using [dart_melty_soundfont](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_melty_soundfont).


## Callback Based, For Real-Time Audio

In contrast to [raw_sound](https://pub.dev/packages/raw_sound), FlutterPcmSound uses a callback `setFeedCallback` to signal when to feed more samples.

You can lower the feed threshold using `setFeedThreshold` to achieve real time audio, or increase it to have a cushy buffer.

## Event Based Feeding

Your feed callback is invoked _once_ for each of these events:
- **Low-buffer event** ‚Äì when the number of buffered frames falls **below** the threshold set with `setFeedThreshold`.
- **Zero event** ‚Äì when the buffer is fully drained (`remainingFrames == 0`).

**Note:** _once_ means once per `feed()` ‚Äî every time you feed new data, it allows the plugin to trigger another low-buffer or zero event.

> üß† **Why event-based feeding?** You might wonder why `flutter_pcm_sound` doesn‚Äôt just use a timer to request more samples every few milliseconds like every other audio library. The problem is asynchronous timing. Whether the timer runs on the Dart or native side, your feed callbacks get bunched up behind Dart UI work, leading to audio delays, pops, & excess work, and means it's not really a reliable "timer". Event-based better reflects the reality of Dart timing without requiring an isolate, and is more efficient.

> üí° **Tip:** You can still emulate timer-style feeding by setting a very large feed threshold so that `flutter_pcm_sound` calls your feed callback regularly. From there, you can also optionally run a Dart-side `Timer.periodic(...)` or `Ticker` and estimate `remainingFrames`  from your last callback + the elapsed time since it fired. You should also consider running this in a Dart `Isolate`.

## One-Pedal Driving

To play audio, just keep calling `feed`. 

To stop audio, just stop calling `feed`.

> üß† **Why no start & stop functions?**  In Flutter, every call that touches the native side happens asynchronously. If playback depended on `await start()` and `await stop()`, you‚Äôd always have to deal with timing jitter between Dart and native while adding additional, needless delay. Instead, `flutter_pcm_sound` takes a simpler approach: `feed()` does everything. Feeding immediately begins playback if needed and seamlessly continues until the buffer is empty ‚Äî i.e. until the feed callback is invoked with `remainingFrames = 0`. If you really want a `stop()` function, you can easily wrap `flutter_pcm_sound` so that `feed()` becomes a no-op while ‚Äústopped.‚Äù This library is designed to be extended and built upon.

## Is Playing?

When your feed callback hits `remainingFrames=0` you know playing stopped.

## Usage

```dart
// for testing purposes, a C-Major scale 
MajorScale scale = MajorScale(sampleRate: 44100, noteDuration: 0.25);

// invoked whenever we need to feed more samples to the platform
void onFeed(int remainingFrames) async {
    // you could use 'remainingFrames' to feed very precisely.
    // But here we just load a few thousand samples everytime we run low.
    List<int> frame = scale.generate(periods: 20);
    await FlutterPcmSound.feed(PcmArrayInt16.fromList(frame));
}

await FlutterPcmSound.setup(sampleRate: 44100, channelCount: 1);
await FlutterPcmSound.setFeedThreshold(8000); 
FlutterPcmSound.setFeedCallback(onFeed);
FlutterPcmSound.start(); // for convenience. Equivalent to calling onFeed(0);
```
